							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I was born on February 26, 2004, in Waldshut-Tiengen, located in the Hochrhein region of Baden-Württemberg. Due to my father's new job, our family moved to Donaueschingen in the Black Forest. I spent my childhood and teenage years there until I turned 16, attending the Realschule Donaueschingen up to the 10th grade.</p>
							<p>Due to personal conflicts, I relocated to Siegen, about a four-hour drive north. There, I completed my secondary education at the Realschule am Oberen Schloss.</p>

							<h2>Education</h2>
							<p>After my experiences in Siegen, I decided to pursue further education instead of immediately entering an apprenticeship. I enrolled at the BBS Betzdorf-Kirchen, where I had some of the best years of my academic journey. The supportive teachers and friendly classmates made this time unforgettable, and I remain in contact with many of them to this day.</p>
